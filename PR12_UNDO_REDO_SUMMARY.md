# PR #12 - Undo/Redo System Implementation Summary

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Branch**: `feature/undo-redo`  
**Date**: October 16, 2025

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive user-scoped undo/redo system for the CollabCanvas application. The system tracks all canvas operations, allows users to undo/redo their own actions, prevents cross-user conflicts, and persists history to localStorage.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 12.1: Create History Context
- **File**: `src/contexts/HistoryContext.tsx`
- Created `HistoryContext` with undo/redo stack management
- State: `undoStack`, `redoStack` (max 50 operations)
- Methods: `pushOperation()`, `undo()`, `redo()`, `canUndo()`, `canRedo()`, `clearHistory()`
- Stores user ID with each operation for user-scoped undo
- Auto-saves to localStorage and loads on mount

### ✅ 12.2: Define Operation Types
- **File**: `src/types/operations.ts`
- Defined comprehensive `Operation` interface:
  - Types: create, move, resize, rotate, delete, duplicate, transform, update
  - Tracks userId, timestamp, before/after state, shapeIds
  - Helper functions: `createOperation()`, `getOperationDescription()`
- `OperationState` interface for state snapshots
- Human-readable operation descriptions

### ✅ 12.3: Create History Hook
- **File**: `src/hooks/useHistory.ts`
- Simple wrapper hook around `HistoryContext`
- Throws error if used outside `HistoryProvider`
- Provides type-safe access to history functions

### ✅ 12.4: Integrate History with Canvas Operations
- **File**: `src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`
- Added `skipHistory` parameter to all operation methods
- Added `setOperationCallback()` for history integration
- Added `recreateShape()` for undo of delete operations
- Captures before/after state for all operations:
  - `addShape()` - tracks shape creation
  - `updateShape()` - tracks updates with before/after state
  - `deleteShape()` - tracks deletion with full shape data
  - `duplicateShape()` - tracks duplication
  - `nudgeShape()` - tracks move operations
- Operations call callback to push to history stack

### ✅ 12.5: Implement Undo Logic
- **File**: `src/components/Canvas/HistoryManager.tsx`
- Created `HistoryManager` component for undo/redo logic
- `performUndo()` function reverses operations by type:
  - create → delete shape
  - delete → recreate shape
  - move/update/transform → restore previous state
- Only undoes current user's operations
- Checks if shape was modified by another user
- Returns success/failure status

### ✅ 12.6: Implement Redo Logic
- **File**: `src/components/Canvas/HistoryManager.tsx`
- `performRedo()` function re-applies operations
- Mirrors undo logic but applies "after" state
- Same user-scoped and conflict detection as undo
- Clear redo stack on any new operation

### ✅ 12.7: Add Keyboard Shortcuts
- **File**: `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`
- Added keyboard shortcuts:
  - `Ctrl+Z` / `Cmd+Z` → undo
  - `Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `Cmd+Shift+Z` → redo
- Integrated with existing `useKeyboard` hook
- Prevents browser defaults
- Shows toast notifications on success/failure

### ✅ 12.8: Add Toolbar Buttons
- **File**: `src/components/Canvas/HistoryButtons.tsx`
- Created undo/redo buttons component
- Positioned at top-left of canvas
- Buttons disabled when `!canUndo` / `!canRedo`
- Tooltips show operation descriptions:
  - "Undo: Deleted 1 shape (Ctrl+Z)"
  - "Redo: Moved 2 shapes (Ctrl+Shift+Z)"
- Visual feedback with hover states
- Updates state every 100ms for real-time feedback

### ✅ 12.9: Add Visual Feedback
- **File**: `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx` (uses existing `ShortcutToast`)
- Reuses existing toast notification system
- Shows success messages: "Undid: Deleted 1 shape"
- Shows error messages: "Cannot undo: shape may have been modified"
- Displays operation descriptions from history

### ✅ 12.10: Handle History Boundaries
- **File**: `src/contexts/HistoryContext.tsx`
- Session-based history (clears on page refresh)
- localStorage persistence for quick refreshes
- Only loads operations from last hour
- Max 50 operations stored
- Version tracking support (for future use)
- Auto-cleans old operations

### ✅ 12.11: Prevent Cross-User Conflicts
- **File**: `src/components/Canvas/HistoryManager.tsx`
- Filters operations by `userId` before undo/redo
- Skips operations by other users automatically
- Checks if shape was modified by another user since operation
- Shows warning toast: "Cannot undo: shape modified by another user"
- Returns failure status if conflict detected

## Technical Architecture

### Operation Flow

```
User Action → Canvas Operation → Operation Callback → History Stack
                                                           ↓
User Undo/Redo ← History Manager ← History Context ← Operation
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Callback Pattern**: Canvas operations notify history via callback to avoid circular dependencies
2. **User-Scoped**: Each user has their own undo/redo stack, tracked by userId
3. **Before/After State**: Operations store full before/after snapshots for reliable reversal
4. **Skip History Flag**: Operations can skip history tracking (for undo/redo operations themselves)
5. **Global Window API**: HistoryManager exposes functions via `window.__historyManager` for access from Canvas component
6. **Conflict Detection**: Checks shape's lastModifiedBy before undoing/redoing
7. **localStorage Persistence**: Saves history to survive quick refreshes (1 hour window)

## Supported Operations

| Operation | Undo Behavior | Redo Behavior | Status |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Create | Delete shape | Recreate shape | ✅ Implemented |
| Delete | Recreate shape | Delete again | ✅ Implemented |
| Move | Restore position | Apply new position | ✅ Implemented |
| Update | Restore previous state | Apply new state | ✅ Implemented |
| Transform | Restore previous state | Apply new state | ✅ Implemented |
| Duplicate | Delete duplicate | Create duplicate | ⚠️ Partial (needs new shape ID tracking) |

## User Experience

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+Z` / `Cmd+Z` - Undo last operation
- `Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `Cmd+Shift+Z` - Redo last undone operation
- Works seamlessly with other keyboard shortcuts (delete, duplicate, nudge)

### Visual Feedback
- Undo/Redo buttons at top-left with icons
- Buttons disabled when no operations available
- Tooltips show what will be undone/redone
- Toast notifications confirm actions
- Real-time button state updates

### Collaborative Behavior
- Each user's undo/redo is independent
- Can't undo other users' operations
- Prevents conflicts when shapes are modified by others
- Clear error messages when conflicts occur

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Undo (Ctrl+Z) works for create operations
- ✅ Undo works for delete operations (recreates shape)
- ✅ Undo works for move operations (restores position)
- ✅ Undo works for update operations (restores state)
- ✅ Redo (Ctrl+Shift+Z) works correctly
- ✅ Only undoes user's own operations
- ✅ History persists through quick refreshes (localStorage)
- ✅ Old operations cleared after 1 hour
- ✅ Max 50 operations stored
- ✅ Toolbar buttons enabled/disabled correctly
- ✅ Tooltips show operation descriptions
- ✅ Visual feedback for all undo/redo actions
- ✅ Cross-user conflict detection works
- ✅ Error toast shown for conflicts

## Known Limitations

1. **Duplicate Operation**: Undo of duplicate doesn't track the new shape ID properly yet. Would need to return the actual created shape ID from Firebase.
2. **Batch Operations**: Multiple operations in quick succession are tracked individually, not as a batch.
3. **Shape Recreation**: When recreating deleted shapes, the Firebase ID generation might differ from the original (depending on implementation).

## Next Steps

Ready to proceed with:
- **PR #13**: Export PNG (canvas/selection)
- **PR #14**: Alignment Tools
- Continue Phase 2 Production tasks

## Performance Considerations

- History stack limited to 50 operations to prevent memory issues
- localStorage operations are async and non-blocking
- Button state updates throttled to 100ms
- Old operations auto-cleaned on load
- Operations stored as JSON for easy serialization

## Security & Privacy

- User-scoped operations prevent cross-user interference
- localStorage is per-user (keyed by userId)
- No sensitive data stored in history
- Operations tracked only for current session + 1 hour window
