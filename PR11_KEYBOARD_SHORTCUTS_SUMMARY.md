# PR #11 - Keyboard Shortcuts Implementation Summary

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Branch**: `feature/shortcuts-core`  
**Date**: October 16, 2025

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive keyboard shortcuts system for the CollabCanvas application, enhancing user productivity and providing intuitive controls for common canvas operations.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 11.1: Create Keyboard Shortcuts Hook
- **File**: `src/hooks/useKeyboard.ts`
- Created `useKeyboard` hook for managing keyboard shortcuts
- Created `useKeyRepeat` hook for handling continuous key press events
- Handles focus/blur states (only active when not typing in inputs)
- Prevents browser default behaviors
- Supports modifier keys (Ctrl, Cmd, Shift, Alt)

### ✅ 11.2: Create Shortcuts Constants
- **File**: `src/utils/constants.ts`
- Added `SHORTCUTS` constant with all keyboard shortcut definitions
- Added `NUDGE_SMALL = 1` and `NUDGE_LARGE = 10` for arrow key nudging
- Added `DUPLICATE_OFFSET = 20` for duplicated shape positioning

### ✅ 11.3: Implement Duplicate Functionality
- **File**: `src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`
- Added `duplicateShape(id)` method to CanvasContextType interface
- Creates deep clone with new ID and offset position (+20px x/y)
- Maintains all properties (size, color, type)
- Prevents duplication of locked shapes
- Uses Firebase for persistence

### ✅ 11.4: Implement Arrow Key Nudge
- **File**: `src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`
- Added `nudgeShape(id, direction, amount)` method
- Supports 4 directions: 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right'
- Applies canvas bounds checking
- Syncs with Firebase in real-time

### ✅ 11.5: Enhance Delete Shortcut
- **File**: `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`
- Moved delete logic from inline to dedicated handler
- Supports both Delete and Backspace keys
- Validates shape is not locked before deletion
- Shows toast notification on success/error

### ✅ 11.6: Implement Escape to Deselect
- **File**: `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`
- Added Escape key handler
- Clears current selection
- Shows toast notification when selection cleared

### ✅ 11.7: Integrate Shortcuts into Canvas
- **File**: `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`
- Registered all keyboard shortcuts using `useKeyboard` hook:
  - Delete/Backspace → Delete shape
  - Ctrl/Cmd+D → Duplicate shape
  - Escape → Clear selection
  - V → Select tool
  - R → Rectangle tool
- Integrated `useKeyRepeat` for arrow key nudging
- All shortcuts respect locked shapes
- Removed old inline keyboard handling code

### ✅ 11.8: Add Visual Feedback
- **File**: `src/components/UI/ShortcutToast.tsx`
- Created toast notification component
- Supports 3 types: success, error, info
- Auto-dismisses after 2 seconds
- Smooth fade in/out animations
- Positioned at bottom center of screen

### ✅ 11.9: Handle Repeat Key Events
- **File**: `src/hooks/useKeyboard.ts`
- `useKeyRepeat` hook handles continuous key press
- Repeats every 50ms for smooth nudging
- Stops on key release
- Throttles to avoid overwhelming Firebase

## Keyboard Shortcuts Implemented

| Shortcut | Action | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `Delete` / `Backspace` | Delete selected shape | Shows error if locked |
| `Ctrl+D` / `Cmd+D` | Duplicate selected shape | Offset by 20px, shows error if locked |
| `Arrow Up` | Nudge shape up | 1px default, 10px with Shift |
| `Arrow Down` | Nudge shape down | 1px default, 10px with Shift |
| `Arrow Left` | Nudge shape left | 1px default, 10px with Shift |
| `Arrow Right` | Nudge shape right | 1px default, 10px with Shift |
| `Escape` | Clear selection | Deselects current shape |
| `V` | Select tool | Switches to selection tool |
| `R` | Rectangle tool | Switches to rectangle drawing tool |
| `Space` | Pan mode | Hold to drag canvas (existing feature) |

## Technical Highlights

1. **Centralized Management**: All shortcuts managed through custom hooks
2. **Conflict Prevention**: Prevents browser defaults (e.g., Ctrl+D bookmark)
3. **Context Awareness**: Ignores shortcuts when typing in input fields
4. **Smooth Nudging**: Arrow keys use repeat events for continuous movement
5. **Visual Feedback**: Toast notifications for all actions
6. **Bounds Checking**: Shapes stay within canvas boundaries
7. **Lock Respect**: All operations respect shape lock state
8. **Cross-platform**: Supports both Ctrl (Windows/Linux) and Cmd (Mac)

## Files Created

- `src/hooks/useKeyboard.ts` - Keyboard shortcut management hooks
- `src/components/UI/ShortcutToast.tsx` - Toast notification component
- `PR11_KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Files Modified

- `src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx` - Added duplicate and nudge methods
- `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx` - Integrated keyboard shortcuts
- `src/utils/constants.ts` - Added shortcut constants
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Updated with PR #11 status
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - Marked PR #11 as completed
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Documented keyboard shortcuts pattern

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Delete works with Backspace/Delete for selected shapes
- ✅ Duplicate (Ctrl/Cmd+D) works and offsets position
- ✅ Arrow nudges 1px by default, 10px with Shift
- ✅ Arrow keys repeat for smooth continuous nudging
- ✅ Escape deselects current selection
- ✅ All shortcuts prevent browser default behaviors
- ✅ Shortcuts don't trigger when typing in inputs
- ✅ Visual feedback (toasts) for all actions
- ✅ Locked shapes cannot be deleted, duplicated, or nudged
- ✅ All operations respect canvas boundaries

## Next Steps

Ready to proceed with:
- **PR #12**: Undo/Redo system
- **PR #13**: Export PNG (canvas/selection)
- Continue Phase 2 Production tasks

## Notes

- User confirmed Delete/Backspace already worked before this PR
- All shortcuts now use the centralized hook system
- Toast notifications enhance UX without being intrusive
- System is extensible for future shortcuts (undo/redo, etc.)
