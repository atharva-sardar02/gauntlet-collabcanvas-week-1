## Progress

What works
- Memory Bank initialized with core files
- Authentication system (signup/login) via Firebase
- Real-time canvas with shape creation and manipulation
- Multi-user presence and cursor tracking
- Shape locking mechanism for collaborative editing
- **Keyboard shortcuts (PR #11 - COMPLETED)**:
  - Delete/Backspace to remove shapes
  - Ctrl/Cmd+D to duplicate shapes
  - Arrow keys to nudge shapes (1px default, 10px with Shift)
  - Escape to clear selection
  - V for select tool, R/C/T/S for shape tools (rectangle, circle, triangle, star)
  - Toast notifications for all actions
- **Undo/Redo system (PR #12 - COMPLETED)**:
  - Ctrl/Cmd+Z to undo (50 operations)
  - Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z to redo (50 operations)
  - User-scoped operations (only undo own actions)
  - Supports: create, delete, move, update, duplicate, transform, reorder
  - localStorage persistence (cleared on browser reload)
  - Visual buttons in Toolbox with tooltips
  - Cross-user conflict detection
  - Fixed redo to work for multiple consecutive operations
  - Shape recreation preserves original IDs for reliable redo
- **Export PNG (PR #13 - COMPLETED)**:
  - Export entire canvas (full 5000x5000px)
  - Export selected shapes only
  - Configurable pixel ratio (1x, 2x, 3x)
  - Loading indicators and toast notifications
  - Export button in Navbar header
- **Conflict Resolution (PR #13.5 - COMPLETED)**:
  - Last-write-wins with server timestamps
  - Optimistic updates with rollback
  - Visual indicators (red flash, toasts, user badges)
  - Rate limiting and debouncing
  - Handles: simultaneous moves, rapid edits, delete vs. edit, create collisions
- **Alignment Tools (PR #14 - COMPLETED)**:
  - Align: left, right, top, bottom, center-h, center-v
  - Distribute: horizontal, vertical
  - Multi-select with Shift+Click
  - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+L/R/T/B/H/V)
  - Integrated in Toolbox
  - Locked shape handling
- **Layer Management (PR #15.5 - COMPLETED)**:
  - Explicit z-index control for shape ordering
  - Bring to front/back, move forward/backward
  - Right-click context menu for layer operations
  - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+]/[, Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+]/[)
  - Layer position indicator in Toolbox
  - Undo/redo support for layer changes
  - Locked shape handling
- **Shape Types**:
  - Rectangle, Circle, Triangle, Star, Text
  - All shapes support drag, resize, rotate, duplicate, delete
  - Text supports bold, italic, underline, font size adjustment
- **Visual Enhancements**:
  - Hover transparency (40% opacity with white border)
  - "Last edited by" badge (top-left inside shapes, 10-second duration)
  - User presence list with avatars
  - Live cursors with user names and colors
  - Inactivity timeout (60 seconds)
- **UI Features**:
  - Consolidated Toolbox with sections (Tools, History, Alignment, Layers)
  - Clear canvas button with confirmation
  - Toast notifications for all actions
  - Tooltips with keyboard shortcuts
  - 2-column layout for compact tool display

What's left to build
- **AI Canvas Agent (PR #19-21)** - IN PLANNING:
  - Backend: AWS Lambda with LangChain (NOT Firebase Functions)
  - 10 tool schemas (create, move, resize, rotate, align, distribute, text, components, export)
  - Frontend: Command bar UI (Ctrl+/), command history, tool execution
  - Architecture: Firebase Hosting → AWS API Gateway → Lambda → OpenAI
- Multi-select marquee selection (PR #10)
- Components system with master/instances (PR #15-17)
- Comments & annotations (PR #18)
- Performance optimization (PR #22)
- Testing & CI (PR #25)
- Collaborative layer management tests (PR #15.5.12)
- Layer utilities unit tests (PR #15.5.13)
- Final polish (PR #26-27)

Current status
- Phase 1 (MVP) completed ✅
- Phase 2 (Production) - PRs #11, #12, #13, #13.5, #14, #15.5 completed ✅
- All core editing features operational
- Collaborative features working (presence, cursors, conflicts)
- Layer management fully implemented
- Deployed to Firebase: https://collabcanvas-f7ee2.web.app

Known issues
- None critical - all TypeScript errors resolved
- Firebase DevTools warning (harmless): "Invalid argument not valid semver"
- Firebase 400 on logout (harmless): Expected SDK behavior with expired tokens
