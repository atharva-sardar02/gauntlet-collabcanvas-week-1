## Project Brief

Purpose: Establish the core scope and goals for the CollabCanvas Week 1 project so future sessions can resume with full context.

Goals
- Real-time collaborative canvas with cursors and presence
- Basic auth (signup/login) using Firebase
- Create/manipulate simple shapes on a shared canvas
- Persistent storage where relevant (Firestore or Realtime DB as applicable)

Non-Goals (Week 1)
- Complex permissions/roles
- Advanced drawing tools beyond shapes and basic controls
- Offline sync/conflict resolution beyond Firebase defaults

Success Criteria
- Users can sign up, sign in, and see each otherâ€™s presence
- Multiple users can see live cursors and interact with shared shapes
- Deployed preview build available per DEPLOYMENT.md

Primary Stakeholders
- Hackathon evaluators and team members
