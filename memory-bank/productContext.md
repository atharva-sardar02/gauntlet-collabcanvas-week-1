## Product Context

Why this project exists
- Enable quick, low-friction collaborative sketching for teams during planning and ideation.
- Provide real-time presence and cursors so users feel co-located.

Problems it solves
- Remote collaboration lacks immediacy and shared spatial context.
- Heavy whiteboarding tools are overkill for simple diagramming and shape manipulation.

How it should work
- Users authenticate, land on a shared canvas, and immediately see othersâ€™ cursors and presence.
- Users create/move basic shapes; updates sync in real time to all participants.

User experience goals
- Fast, minimal UI focused on collaboration.
- Visible presence (avatars/initials), live cursors with names/colors.
- Predictable interactions and no surprising jumps when others edit.
