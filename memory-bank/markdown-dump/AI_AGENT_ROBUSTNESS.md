---

## 🎯 Example Abrupt Prompts & How They're Handled

### **1. Vague References**

| User Says | Agent Interprets |
|-----------|------------------|
| "make it bigger" | Calls getShapes → finds most recent shape → doubles its size |
| "move it left" | Calls getShapes → finds most recent shape → subtracts 100 from x |
| "rotate it" | Calls getShapes → finds most recent shape → rotates 45° |
| "the blue one" | Filters getShapes by fill color matching "blue" |
| "that thing" | Finds most recent shape |

---

### **2. Missing Information**

| User Says | Agent Fills In |
|-----------|----------------|
| "create a circle" | Position: (500, 500), Size: 60 radius, Color: blue (#3B82F6) |
| "make it red" | Finds shape via getShapes, updates fill to #EF4444 |
| "bigger" | Increases size by 2x (200%) |
| "way bigger" | Increases size by 3x-4x |
| "a bit bigger" | Increases size by 1.5x (150%) |
| "rotate it" | Rotates by 45 degrees (default) |

---

### **3. Natural Language Variations**

#### Action Verbs
| User Says | Mapped To |
|-----------|-----------|
| "spin it" / "twist it" / "turn it" | `rotateShape` |
| "expand it" / "grow it" / "enlarge it" | `resizeShape` (bigger) |
| "shrink it" / "reduce it" | `resizeShape` (smaller) |
| "shift it" / "slide it" | `moveShape` |
| "line them up" / "straighten them" | `align` |
| "spread them out" | `distribute` |
| "stack them" | Align vertically with small spacing |

#### Layout Commands
| User Says | Agent Does |
|-----------|------------|
| "organize them" | Calls getShapes → distribute evenly |
| "clean it up" | Align and distribute shapes |
| "make it nice" | Align shapes, add consistent spacing |
| "fix the layout" | Distribute evenly, align to grid |

---

### **4. Color Keywords**

| User Says | Hex Code |
|-----------|----------|
| "red" | #EF4444 |
| "blue" | #3B82F6 |
| "green" | #10B981 |
| "yellow" | #F59E0B |
| "purple" | #8B5CF6 |
| "pink" | #EC4899 |
| "orange" | #F97316 |
| "gray" | #6B7280 |
| "black" | #000000 |
| "white" | #FFFFFF |

---

### **5. Quantity Interpretation**

| User Says | Agent Creates |
|-----------|---------------|
| "a few shapes" | 5 shapes |
| "many shapes" | 20 shapes |
| "lots of circles" | 20 circles |
| "some rectangles" | 5 rectangles |

---

### **6. Ambiguous References**

**When canvas has multiple shapes:**

| User Says | Agent Resolves To |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "the shape" (singular) | Most recently created/modified shape |
| "the shapes" (plural) | All shapes on canvas |
| "all of them" | All shapes on canvas |
| "the red rectangle" | getShapes filter: {type: "rectangle", fill: "red"} |
| "the circle" | getShapes filter: {type: "circle"} → most recent if multiple |

---

### **7. Context Understanding**

| User Says | Context Clue | Agent Interprets |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| "center it" | Has shapes on canvas | Move to center (2500, 2500) |
| "delete everything" | Has shapes on canvas | getShapes → delete all IDs |
| "make them blue" | "them" = plural | getShapes → update all to blue |
| "organize these" | "these" implies existing | getShapes → distribute |

---

### **8. Typo Handling**

| User Types | Agent Understands |
|------------|-------------------|
| "recangle" / "reactangle" | rectangle |
| "cirlce" / "circl" | circle |
| "teh shape" | the shape |
| "makee it bigger" | make it bigger |

**Agent is flexible with:**
- Missing letters
- Extra letters
- Swapped letters
- Wrong spacing
- Missing punctuation

---

### **9. Proactive Interpretation**

| User Says | Agent Creates |
|-----------|---------------|
| "create a form" | createComplexLayout(type: 'login_form') |
| "make a menu" | createComplexLayout(type: 'navbar') |
| "dashboard layout" | createComplexLayout(type: 'dashboard') |
| "button group" | createComplexLayout(type: 'button_group') |

---

### **10. Error Recovery**

**Scenario: User asks to modify, but no shapes exist**
- Agent calls getShapes
- Gets 0 results
- Response: "No shapes found. Would you like me to create some first?"

**Scenario: Multiple shapes match singular reference**
- User: "rotate the circle"
- Canvas has 3 circles
- Agent uses most recent circle

**Scenario: Impossible request**
- User: "delete the shape that doesn't exist"
- Agent: "I couldn't find any shapes matching that description."

## 🛠️ Smart Defaults

### Position
- **Not specified**: (500, 500)
- **"center"**: (2500, 2500)
- **"left"**: Current x - 100
- **"right"**: Current x + 100

### Size
- **Rectangles**: 100 × 80
- **Circles**: 60 radius (120 diameter)
- **Text**: 16px font size

### Color
- **Shapes**: Blue (#3B82F6)
- **Text**: Black (#000000)
- **Can be overridden by color keywords**

### Rotation
- **"rotate it"**: 45 degrees
- **"spin it around"**: 180 degrees
- **"flip it"**: 180 degrees

### Resize Multipliers
- **"bigger"**: 2x
- **"way bigger"**: 3x-4x
- **"a bit bigger"**: 1.5x
- **"smaller"**: 0.5x
- **"much smaller"**: 0.25x

## 🧠 Intelligent Workflow

### Example: "make it bigger"

```
1. Analyze command:
   - Action: resize
   - Target: "it" (ambiguous reference)
   - Amount: not specified

2. Resolve ambiguity:
   - Call getShapes (no filter)
   - Find most recently modified shape
   - Extract ID

3. Apply smart defaults:
   - "bigger" = 2x multiplier
   - Calculate: new_width = current_width * 2

4. Execute:
   - Call resizeShape(id, new_width, new_height)
   
5. Success!
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ **Handles vague commands**: "make it bigger" works  
✅ **Handles missing info**: "create a circle" uses defaults
