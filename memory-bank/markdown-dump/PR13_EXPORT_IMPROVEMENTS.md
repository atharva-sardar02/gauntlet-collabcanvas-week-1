## User Feedback Addressed

### Issue 1: Export Canvas Only Captures Viewport
**Problem:** When exporting the full canvas, only the visible viewport area was being exported, not the entire 5000x5000px canvas.

**Solution:** Modified `exportCanvas()` in `src/services/export.ts` to:
1. Store the original stage transform (position and scale)
2. Reset stage to position (0, 0) and scale (1, 1) before export
3. Export the entire canvas at actual size
4. Restore original transform after export

This ensures users get the complete canvas regardless of zoom level or pan position.

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Store original transform
const originalX = stage.x();
const originalY = stage.y();
const originalScaleX = stage.scaleX();
const originalScaleY = stage.scaleY();

// Reset transform to capture entire canvas (not just viewport)
stage.position({ x: 0, y: 0 });
stage.scale({ x: 1, y: 1 });

// Export
const dataURL = stage.toDataURL({ pixelRatio, mimeType: 'image/png', quality });

// Restore original transform
stage.position({ x: originalX, y: originalY });
stage.scale({ x: originalScaleX, y: originalScaleY });
```

### Issue 2: Export Button Better in Header Bar
**Problem:** Export button was in the bottom-right canvas controls, user requested it in the header bar for better accessibility.

**Solution:** Moved export button to the Navbar (header bar) between the logo and user info.

**Changes Made:**

1. **Updated `Navbar.tsx`:**
   - Added `onExport` and `hasShapes` props
   - Added green "Export" button with download icon
   - Button shows/hides "Export" text on mobile (icon only on small screens)
   - Disabled state when no shapes
   - Tooltip: "Export Canvas (Ctrl/Cmd+E)" or "No shapes to export"

2. **Updated `Canvas.tsx`:**
   - Added `onExportRequest` prop to communicate with parent
   - Used `useEffect` to provide export handler to Navbar via callback
   - Removed export button from CanvasControls integration

3. **Updated `CanvasControls.tsx`:**
   - Removed `onExport` and `hasShapes` props
   - Removed export button (now in Navbar)

4. **Updated `App.tsx`:**
   - Added state for `exportHandler` and `hasShapes`
   - Created `handleExportRequest` callback
   - Passed export handler and state to Navbar
   - Canvas provides handler via `onExportRequest` prop

---

## UI/UX Improvements

### Export Button in Navbar
- **Location:** Top header bar, between logo and user profile
- **Color:** Green (bg-green-600) for clear "export/download" action
- **Icon:** Download arrow icon
- **Text:** "Export" (hidden on mobile, shows icon only)
- **States:**
  - **Enabled:** Hover effect with scale and green glow shadow
  - **Disabled:** Grayed out when no shapes, cursor not-allowed, no hover effects
- **Tooltip:** Context-sensitive tooltip explains state

### Button Hierarchy in Navbar
```
[Logo] [Export Button] [User Avatar] [User Name] [Logout]
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
```
Canvas (has shapes + export handler)
   ‚Üì (via onExportRequest callback)
App.tsx (stores handler + hasShapes state)
   ‚Üì (via props)
Navbar (receives handler + hasShapes)
   ‚Üì (user clicks)
handleOpenExportDialog() in Canvas
   ‚Üì
ExportDialog opens
```

### Key Benefits
1. **No Props Drilling:** Canvas provides handler to parent, parent passes to Navbar
2. **Reactive State:** hasShapes updates automatically when shapes change
3. **Clean Separation:** Export logic stays in Canvas, UI in Navbar
4. **Consistent UX:** Export button always visible in header (when logged in)
