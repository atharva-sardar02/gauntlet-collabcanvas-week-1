## Active Context

Current focus
- Implementing Undo/Redo system (PR #12) for advanced editing capabilities.

Recent changes

- Implemented full Undo/Redo system (PR #12) ✅:
  - Created `HistoryContext` with undo/redo stacks and localStorage persistence
  - Created `Operation` types for tracking all canvas operations
  - Integrated history tracking with all Canvas operations (create, delete, update, move, duplicate)
  - Added undo/redo keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+Z, Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z)
  - Added visual undo/redo buttons with tooltips
  - Implemented user-scoped operations (only undo your own actions)
  - Added cross-user conflict detection

Next steps
- Continue with remaining Phase 2 Production tasks (PR #13: Export PNG, etc.)
- Keep `progress.md` updated as features stabilize.
- Document any new architectural decisions in `systemPatterns.md`.

Active decisions
- History is session-based with localStorage persistence (up to 50 operations)
- Only user's own operations can be undone to prevent cross-user conflicts
- History operations track before/after state for reliable reversal
- Operations are tracked via callback pattern to avoid circular dependencies
