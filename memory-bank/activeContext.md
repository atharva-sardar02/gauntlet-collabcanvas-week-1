## Active Context

Current focus
- Implementing keyboard shortcuts (PR #11) for improved UX.

Recent changes
- Created Memory Bank core files and seeded initial content.
- Implemented comprehensive keyboard shortcuts system (PR #11):
  - Created `useKeyboard` and `useKeyRepeat` hooks for centralized shortcut management
  - Added duplicate (Ctrl/Cmd+D), delete (Delete/Backspace), escape, and arrow nudging
  - Integrated toast notifications for user feedback
  - Enhanced CanvasContext with `duplicateShape` and `nudgeShape` methods

Next steps
- Continue with remaining Phase 2 Production tasks (PR #12+)
- Keep `progress.md` updated as features stabilize.
- Document any new architectural decisions in `systemPatterns.md`.

Active decisions
- Keyboard shortcuts use custom hooks to centralize logic and prevent browser defaults
- Arrow key nudging supports repeat events for smooth continuous movement
- Toast notifications provide non-intrusive feedback for all keyboard actions
