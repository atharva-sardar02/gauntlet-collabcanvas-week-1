 * 4. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) doesn't apply to creates â†’ No winner/loser
 * 
 * This is different from update conflicts where one change overwrites another.
 * For creates, both operations succeed and both shapes exist on the canvas.
 * 
 * Optional Enhancement:
 * - Could auto-offset second shape to avoid visual overlap
 * - Could show notification: "Multiple shapes created at same location"
 * - Could highlight recently created shapes for visibility
 * 
 * But these are UI polish, not conflict resolution requirements.
