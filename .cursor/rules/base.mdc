Description: Project memory and workflow rules for CollabCanvas

Content:
- Always read `memory-bank/*.md` at the start of each task.
- Update `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` after significant changes.
- Capture architecture decisions in `systemPatterns.md`.
- Keep `techContext.md` synced with `package.json`.
- Use `.cursor/rules/` for learned project patterns; reference with @file when needed.
