## PR #13.5 â€” Conflict Resolution & Simultaneous Edit Handling

**Rubric Section**: 1 (Collaborative Infrastructure)  
**Branch**: `feature/conflict-resolution`  
**Goal**: Robust handling of simultaneous edits with clear conflict resolution strategy

### Background:

Current implementation uses **server-authoritative updates** with Firestore real-time sync, which provides basic conflict handling through last-write-wins. This PR enhances the system with:
- Explicit conflict detection
- Visual feedback for conflicts
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback
- Clear documentation of conflict resolution strategy

### Conflict Resolution Strategy:

**Approach: Last-Write-Wins (LWW) with Timestamp + Visual Feedback**

Rationale:
- Simple and predictable for users
- Works well with Firestore's real-time sync
- No complex operational transforms needed
- Clear visual indicators prevent confusion

### Tasks:

- [ ] **13.5.1: Document Conflict Resolution Strategy**
  - Files to create: `docs/CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md`
  - Document: Last-Write-Wins (LWW) approach
  - Explain: Firestore timestamp-based conflict resolution
  - Describe: Visual feedback mechanisms
  - List: Known edge cases and handling

- [ ] **13.5.2: Add Conflict Detection System**
  - Files to create: `src/utils/conflictDetection.ts`
  - Function: `detectConflict(localOp, remoteOp)` - checks for conflicting operations
  - Function: `shouldResolveConflict(localTimestamp, remoteTimestamp)` - LWW logic
  - Function: `getConflictType(op1, op2)` - categorizes conflicts (move vs move, delete vs edit, etc.)
  - Types: Define conflict types (SIMULTANEOUS_MOVE, DELETE_WHILE_EDITING, RAPID_EDIT_STORM, etc.)

- [ ] **13.5.3: Enhance Shape Metadata for Conflict Detection**
  - Files to update: `src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`
  - Add to Shape interface:
    - `version: number` - increments on each edit
    - `lastModifiedTimestamp: number` - Firestore server timestamp
    - `editSessionId?: string` - unique ID for current edit session
  - Files to update: `src/services/canvas.ts`
  - Use Firestore `serverTimestamp()` for all updates
  - Include version number in all shape updates

- [ ] **13.5.4: Implement Optimistic Updates with Rollback**
  - Files to create: `src/hooks/useOptimisticUpdates.ts`
  - Track: Pending local operations (not yet confirmed by server)
  - Function: `applyOptimistic(operation)` - applies change immediately
  - Function: `rollbackOptimistic(operation)` - reverts if server rejects
  - Function: `confirmOptimistic(operation)` - removes from pending on server confirm
  - Queue: Maintain queue of pending operations with timeouts

- [ ] **13.5.5: Add Visual Conflict Indicators**
  - Files to create: `src/components/Canvas/ConflictIndicator.tsx`
  - Red flash animation when local edit is overwritten
  - Toast notification: "Your change was overwritten by [User Name]"
  - Temporary highlight on shape showing who made the last edit
  - Duration: 2 seconds, then fade out

- [ ] **13.5.6: Implement Conflict Logging**
  - Files to create: `src/utils/conflictLogger.ts`
  - Log all detected conflicts to console (dev mode)
  - Track metrics: conflict frequency, types, resolution time
  - Function: `logConflict(type, users, resolution)` - structured logging
  - Optional: Send to analytics service

- [ ] **13.5.7: Handle Simultaneous Move Conflicts**
  - Files to update: `src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`
  - Scenario: Two users drag same shape at same time
  - Implementation:
    - User A starts drag â†’ local optimistic update
    - User B starts drag â†’ local optimistic update
    - Server receives A's drag first â†’ A wins (LWW)
    - User B sees shape jump back to A's position + conflict indicator
  - Add debouncing: 100ms delay before sending drag updates

- [ ] **13.5.8: Handle Rapid Edit Storm Conflicts**
  - Files to update: `src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`
  - Scenario: Multiple rapid edits (resize, color, move) on same shape
  - Implementation:
    - Queue updates locally with timestamps
    - Send batched updates every 100ms
    - On conflict: show "Shape being edited by multiple users" warning
    - Last edit wins (most recent server timestamp)

- [ ] **13.5.9: Handle Delete vs Edit Conflicts**
  - Files to update: `src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`
  - Scenario: User A deletes shape while User B is editing it
  - Implementation:
    - User B's edit arrives after delete â†’ shape stays deleted
    - Show toast to User B: "Shape was deleted by [User A]"
    - Offer "Undo delete" button (creates new shape with User B's edits)
  - Add confirmation: "This shape is being edited by [User B], delete anyway?"

- [ ] **13.5.10: Handle Create Collision Conflicts**
  - Files to update: `src/services/canvas.ts`
  - Scenario: Two users create shapes at nearly identical timestamps
  - Implementation:
    - Firestore auto-generates unique IDs â†’ no ID collision
    - If positions overlap: no conflict (both shapes exist)
    - No special handling needed (LWW doesn't apply to creates)

- [ ] **13.5.11: Add Conflict Resolution UI**
  - Files to create: `src/components/UI/ConflictResolutionPanel.tsx`
  - Show when conflict detected (optional modal/panel)
  - Display: "Your edit conflicted with [User Name]"
  - Options:
    - "Keep their changes" (default, already applied)
    - "Revert to my version" (re-apply local change)
  - Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds if no action

- [ ] **13.5.12: Add Rate Limiting for Rapid Edits**
  - Files to create: `src/utils/rateLimiter.ts`
  - Limit: Max 10 updates/second per shape
  - Implementation: Debounce + throttle combo
  - Function: `rateLimitUpdate(shapeId, operation)` - queues if over limit
  - Prevents: Firestore quota exhaustion and state corruption

- [ ] **13.5.13: Add Conflict Detection Tests**
  - Files to create: `tests/integration/conflict-resolution.test.ts`
  - Test: Simultaneous move (two users drag same shape)
  - Test: Rapid edit storm (resize + color + move simultaneously)
  - Test: Delete vs edit (delete during active edit)
  - Test: Create collision (two creates at same timestamp)
  - Test: Optimistic update rollback
  - Mock: Firestore responses with controlled timing

### Conflict Resolution Flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UserA
    participant LocalA
    participant Firestore

```

### Testing Scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Simultaneous Move
```
Setup:
- User A and User B both have shape selected
- Shape at position (100, 100)

Actions:
1. User A drags shape to (200, 100) at T1
2. User B drags shape to (100, 200) at T2 (20ms later)

Expected Result:
- Shape ends at (100, 200) (T2 is more recent)
- User A sees red flash + toast: "Your move was overwritten by User B"
- User B sees no conflict (their edit won)
- No ghost shapes or duplicates
```

#### Scenario 2: Rapid Edit Storm
```
Setup:
- User A, B, C all editing same shape
- Shape: 100x100 rectangle at (50, 50), color blue

Actions (within 500ms):
1. User A: Resize to 200x100 at T1
2. User B: Change color to red at T2 (50ms later)
3. User C: Move to (150, 50) at T3 (100ms later)
4. User A: Resize to 250x100 at T4 (150ms later)

Expected Result:
- Final state: 250x100, red, at (150, 50)
- Each property resolved independently (LWW per field)
- Users see temporary inconsistencies (< 200ms)
- All users converge to same final state
- No corruption of width/height/color/position
```

#### Scenario 3: Delete vs Edit
```
Setup:
- User A selecting shape
- User B actively editing same shape (dragging)

Actions:
1. User B starts dragging at T1
2. User A presses Delete at T2
3. User B releases drag at T3 (after delete)

Expected Result:
- Shape is deleted (delete at T2 wins)
- User B sees toast: "Shape was deleted by User A"
- User B's drag update arrives but shape already deleted (no-op)
- Optional: "Undo delete" button for User B
- No ghost shape created
```

#### Scenario 4: Create Collision
```
Setup:
- User A and User B both in draw mode
- Both drawing rectangles at similar positions

Actions:
1. User A creates rect at (100, 100) at T1
2. User B creates rect at (105, 105) at T2 (10ms later)

Expected Result:
- Both rectangles exist (no collision, different IDs)
- Shapes may overlap visually (expected, no conflict)
- User A sees their shape + User B's shape
- User B sees both shapes
- No duplicate or merged shapes
```

### Performance Targets:

- **Conflict Detection Latency:** < 50ms
- **Visual Feedback Delay:** < 100ms after conflict
- **Optimistic Update:** Instant (0ms perceived latency)
- **Rollback Time:** < 100ms
